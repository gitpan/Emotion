context must accept multiple situations? (answer too?)

exposes -> observes -> exposes =? taunting

"answer" seems like the wrong word.  should be "question" or
"cataylst" or "trigger" or ?

rename "context"?

"echo" is too specific?

"The criteria for whether the markup is detailed enough is whether it
delineates single emotions."

A one-to-one mapping of *fully detailed markup* to emotion. 

   Hmm: The POD is for emotions, yet you only define markups for competition
   events. Are you saying that there is a one-to-one mapping from competition
   event styles to emotions?

   What i am proposing is to look at a scene as a
   sequences of moments. You could even say that
   every moment is an *independent* <steals/> event.
   The question is: into how many slices must we
   divide the timeline such that each slice is
   exactly one emotion?
