impasse cannot be in answer to ready|observes|uneasy|nothing

context and closing must accept multiple situations (answer too?)

convert left/right -> L/R

echo
  impasse id=a1
  impasse echo=a1 absent=right

merge prepare_* into a single command-line tool
  empathize --index ...

duration index

rename "context"?

<alias newtag="demands" basetag="accepts" before="focused" initiator="right"
/>

"The criteria for whether the markup is detailed enough is whether it
delineates single emotions."

A one-to-one mapping of *fully detailed markup* to emotion. 



   Hmm: The POD is for emotions, yet you only define markups for competition
   events. Are you saying that there is a one-to-one mapping from competition
   event styles to emotions?

   What i am proposing is to look at a scene as a
   sequences of moments. You could even say that
   every moment is an *independent* <steals/> event.
   The question is: into how many slices must we
   divide the timeline such that each slice is
   exactly one emotion?
